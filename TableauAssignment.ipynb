        "Question 1 : What is Tableau? Explain its importance in Business Intelligence and how it helps in data-driven decision-making.\n",
        "- Tableau is a data visualization tool that helps people see and understand their data. It simplifies raw data into an easily understandable format, enabling users to create interactive dashboards, reports, and charts.\n",
        "- Its importance lies in empowering users—technical and non-technical—to visually explore data, enabling quick identification of patterns and fostering a data-driven culture for informed, real-time decisions across industries like finance, retail, and healthcare.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2 : Explain the role of the following Tableau components:\n",
        "a) Data Pane\n",
        "b) Worksheet\n",
        "c) Dashboard\n",
        "d) Story\n",
        "- Data Pane: The Data Pane is located on the side of a worksheet and displays all the fields (dimensions and measures) available from the connected data source\n",
        "- Worksheet: A Worksheet is the fundamental canvas where individual data visualizations, such as a single chart or a graph, are created\n",
        "- Dashboard: A Dashboard is a consolidated view that brings together multiple worksheets and related information in a single screen\n",
        "- Story: A Story contains a sequence of worksheets or dashboards (called story points) that work together in a guided narrative\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3 : What is the difference between Dimensions and Measures in Tableau? Provide examples of each.\n",
        "- Dimensions are qualitative, descriptive data that segment your data and answer \"what/who/where/when,\" appearing as blue discrete headers.\n",
        "- Measures are quantitative, numerical data that you aggregate to answer \"how much/many,\" appearing as green continuous pills, creating axes. Dimensions provide context and detail, while measures provide values for calculations and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4 : Define and explain the purpose of Filters, Parameters, and Sets in Tableau.\n",
        "- Filters reduce data shown in a view  \n",
        "- Parameters provide user-controlled, single-value inputs\n",
        "- Sets group data members for comparisons, all enhancing interactivity and analysis by letting users dynamically slice, control, and compare data without editing the underlying data source.\n",
